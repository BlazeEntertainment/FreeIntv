# FreeIntv
a libretro emulation core for the Mattell Intellivision with the ability to play games with a SNES- or PlayStation-style joypad even if they originally required a number pad.

* The FreeIntv "mini keypad" allows you to view and press keys on a small keypad that appears in the lower-corner of the display while L or R is being held.
* The "X" button is also mapped to the last selected keypad button, giving quick access. In Astrosmash, for example, you can leave "3" selected to enable instant access to hyperspace.
* The select button lets you switch the left and right controllers. Some games expect the left controller to be player one, others expect the right controller. This isn't a problem if you have two controllers (and don't mind juggling them) but users with only one controller or using a portable setup would be effectively locked out of some games. Pressing select from either controller with swap the left controller for the right and vice-versa.
